# WebFileDownloader will download files linked in web pages
In its current state, it searches the given web page for links to mp3 files and downloads them to the current directory.

## Why the hell I make this??
Because for some reason I wanted to download all the mp3 files from this website: http://www.planecrashinfo.com/lastwords.htm (TRIGGER WARNING: AIRPLANE CRASHES)

## Why the hell might you want to use this?????
I have no idea, you'd probably be better off building your own sort of
thing from scratch in your language of choice. It can be easily modified though to download any filetype you want, perhaps by accepting a list of formats as an argument (maybe I'll do this later...)
